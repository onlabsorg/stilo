* PROJ Version 0.18.0

A stilo package is a local directory that contains a npm package under the
folder `.stilo`. The package can be created with the `stilo init` command.

Tthe available stilo commands are:

- stilo init          initializes a stilo package
- stilo read          reads and outpupts the content of a document of the package
- stilo list          retrieves and outputs the list of the document under a give path
- stilo render        evaluate a document of the package and outputs its rendered content
- stilo install       installs a plugin
- stilo uninstall     removes a plugin
- stilo run           executes a custom command

The `.stilo` npm package exports the following API, which in principle can
be modified to customize the package, but in general it works as folows:

- `stilo.getStore` returns the stilo olojs store rooted in the stilo package folder.
  The returned store is used by the commands `stilo read` and `stilo render`.

- `stilo.getCommands` returns all the custom commands (plugin extensions) available.
  The returnsed commands are then used by `stilo commands` and `stilo run`.

- `stilo.registerPlugin` gets executed by `stilo install` after installing a plugin

- `stilo.unregisterPlugin` gets executed by `stilo uninstall` before removing a plugin

** DONE Consolidate store commands
- [X] Consolidate and test init
- [X] Consolidate and test read
- [X] Consolidate and test render

** TODO Consolidate plugin installation
Every plugin exports an object containing the `plugin.routes` and the `plugin.commands`
objects.
- [X] Update and test the `stilo install` and `stilo.registerPlugin` hooks
- [X] Update and test the `stilo uninstall` and `stilo.unregisterPlugin` hooks

** TODO Consolidate plugin's custom routes
Any route is possible, but the plugin should be "polite" and namespace its
mounting points. The `stilo mount` command (backlogged).
- [X] Update and test the `stilo.getStore` method

** TODO Consolidate plugin's custom commands
Plugins exports an object where every item is a function that executes a command.
Comment lines starting with `///` are used as documentation by `stilo help`. Every
command function rceives `(store, cwd, args)` as parameters.
- [X] Update and test `stilo.getCommands`, `stilo commands` and `stilo run`

** TODO Update http server
- [X] The server should be implemented as a builtin command: `stilo run http-server`

** TODO Update documentation
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Update cli.md
- [ ] Update README.md in template package




* BACKLOG:
** TODO CLI: add run-and-repl command
Evaluate a document and start an interactive REPL in the resulting context
** TODO CLI: implement autocompletion
** TODO custom package templates
A custom stilo package should be installable as `stilo init package-url`.
Package specifications should be available to developers as mocha tests.
** TODO Implement `stilo mount` and `stilo unmount` commands
The command should use the .stilo/package.json's `stilo.mountpoints` object
to add routes to the store upon store creation (i.e. in `stilo.getStore`).
