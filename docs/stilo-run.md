# stilo run
The `run` command executes a custom stilo command exported by the local
.stilo package. For a list of the commands available in the current package,
enter:
```
stilo run --help
```
In the default implementation of the .stilo npm package, the custom
commands can be either defined in `.stilo/bin/index.js` or by
plugins. See the [degault package documentation](../package-template/README.md)
for more information.
